租车）的忠诚信徒，往年我都是选择高铁进出城，然后直接在高铁站租车。这样可以避开节假日进出城的高峰车流。事实证明我过去的想法是完全正确的，清明上午 9 点出发，光是出上海市区就花了快 3 小时，路上目睹了 3 个事故现场，好在都是擦碰小事故。</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\"%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%A4%A9\">Ⅲ、第一天</h2>\\n\\n<h3

We planned to use the GPS to guide us to less crowded spots.\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-1.png)\\n\\n## Departure\\n\\nThis was my first experience driving out of the city on the first day of a holiday.\\n\\nTypically, as a faithful adherent of the P+R (high-speed train + rental car) method, I used to take the high-speed train and rent a car at the station, avoiding peak holiday traffic. The wisdom of this approach was proven once again when we began our journey at 9 AM on Qingming morning; just exiting Shanghai took nearly three hours, and we witnessed three minor accidents along the way.\\n\\n## Day One\\n\\n### Liu River\\n\\nOur destination was a scenic lookout on the riverbank we found on the map. Surprisingly, after exiting from G346, it was single-lane rural roads all the way. Just 1km from our destination, we hit a traffic jam. Locals mentioned that it was blocked ahead and the only way out was to turn around.\\n\\nI decided to reverse immediately since the roads into the village were narrow and newcomers kept arriving. After about ten minutes in line, we were lucky enough to get out, though those stuck inside might have had a longer wait.\\n\\nNext, we found the nearest riverside scenic spot on the map, [Jiangtan Wetland Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gneR18YvD8p1FU9Q7), but it was showing heavy traffic. Since it was lunchtime, I searched for nearby restaurants and found [Liu River Ancient Town](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SsT4DWiNmQ4W1dkY7) close by with plenty of dining options. We stopped at a local place for some tender fish in sauerkraut soup.\\n\\n| ![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-2.JPG) | ![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-3.jpeg) |\\n| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\\n\\nAfter lunch, we strolled through Liu River Ancient Town, and my socially adept son struck up a conversation with a local elderly lady, even sharing peanuts together 😂.\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-lh-1.jpeg)\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-lh-2.jpeg)\\n\\n### Zheng He Park\\n\\nAfter resting in Liu River, we still wanted to visit the riverside and chose [Zheng He Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jwonLhgEj7xaKNWr5).\\n\\nWe estimated our arrival around 4:10 PM, close to closing time. The traffic had eased, and there were available parking spots. The park, adjacent to Taicang Port, is renowned as the historical departure point of Zheng He 600 years ago. It features an 18-meter tall bronze statue of Zheng He and a wooden replica of the Zheng He Number Two Treasure Ship. Visitors can go onto the deck of the ship, though other areas are off-limits.\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-zh-1.jpeg)\\n\\nThe god of Kubernetes:\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-zh-2.jpeg)\\n\\nThe park\\'s greenery is well-maintained, and my son had a great time rolling around:\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-zh-3.jpeg)\\n\\nAfter leaving Zheng He Park, [continuing east for 100 meters brings you to the Yangtze River bank](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mZVBuMYSVpaHSRWw8), though the view is somewhat obstructed by Chongming Island across the river.\\n\\nIn the evening, we reached Changshu City and dined at [Shanxi Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mwqpWbnM3gbJ2uQa9).\\n\\n| ![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-sx-1.JPG) | ![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-sx-2.jpeg) |\\n| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |\\n\\nWe wanted to order pocket-roasted lamb, but unfortunately, it was sold out. The lamb paomo was served not with traditional naan but with small grain semi-finished noodles, which luckily my son enjoyed, having been told it was his favorite rice cake noodles 😓. He also had plenty of lamb.\\n\\n## Day Two\\n\\n### Kun Cheng Lake\\n\\nWe started our second day with breakfast at [Han Hui Noodle Shop](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bG2VdS7h8sGsiwcB6) nearby, where food is cooked fresh and an auntie prepares pork cutlets, freshly fried and cut into strips with scissors.\\n\\n| ![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-hh-01.jpeg) | ![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-hh-02.jpeg) |\\n| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\\n\\nWe had planned to visit Yu Mountain, which reportedly has a large underground parking lot. However, upon arrival, we found numerous traffic officers directing traffic, and the parking lot was declared full. We shifted our plans and found a large lake called [Kun Cheng Lake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vwMoYaEujgvu2LMe7) nearby on the map.\\n\\nThe drive from Yu Mountain to Kun Cheng Lake only took about 20 minutes. There, we found a small lakeside trail where we could park the car right by the lake. It offered a quite open view where we sat and enjoyed the sunlight for a while.\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-kch.jpeg)\\n\\n### Yangcheng Lake\\n\\nAfter enjoying Kun Cheng Lake, we discovered that Yangcheng Lake was located just to the south, so we drove to the midsection of the lake at [Lotus Island Dock](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WP4E3g8A2gL7mMsw8).\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-ych-1.png)\\n\\nSomewhat confusedly, we bought two round-trip ferry tickets there (children under 1.4 meters ride free) and boarded the ferry to Lotus Island.\\n\\nPs. The ferry service from the mainland to Lotus Island runs every half an hour.\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-ych-2.jpeg)\\n\\nAlthough visiting Lotus Island was completely unexpected, it turned out to be the highlight of our trip. The island was sparsely populated and the maintenance was minimal, but it boasted an expansive natural lawn dotted with small yellow flowers. The sight was akin to a vast golden carpet, and the thick grass felt soft underfoot, perfectly aligning with the Qingming festival theme of enjoying the greenery of spring.\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-ych-3.jpeg)\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-ych-4.jpeg)\\n\\nDue to the off-season, there were scarce dining options on Lotus Island. We managed to catch the noon ferry back and started looking for a place to eat. We passed several family-run farmhouses, but since it was already past 1 PM, local restaurants had closed for a break.\\n\\nConsidering the child needed a nap in the afternoon, we simply headed to the nearest hotel and looked around the area for food. We ended up at a nondescript local restaurant and ordered a grilled fish. Jokingly, I remarked to the owner that he could just \"heat it up in the microwave.\" I had no idea about the amazing capabilities of small-town hospitality. The owner fetched a lively black fish from a small pond at the entrance, slaughtered and cleaned it right there on a preparation table behind the counter, and then perfectly grilled it to a crispy tenderness. The deliciously fresh grilled fish was served in just 20 minutes.\\n\\n| ![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-ky-1.JPG) | ![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-ky-2.jpeg) |\\n| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |\\n\\nWhile enjoying the crisp and tender grilled fish, we couldn\\'t help but reflect on the subpar and overpriced dining experiences back in Shanghai, largely comprised of half-prepared dishes.\\n\\n### Jinxi Ancient Town\\n\\nAfter the meal, we booked a short-stay room in the hotel and slept until 5 PM.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting for families traveling with young children, short-stay rooms are an excellent option—typically priced between 100 to 150 for a four-hour rest, they provide a comfortable environment for kids to take a refreshing nap.\\n\\nWe planned to head back to Shanghai in the evening. On the way, we passed by Dianshan Lake and decided to quickly visit Jinxi Ancient Town, which we had never been to before.\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-jx-2.jpeg)\\n\\n![](https://s3.laisky.com/uploads/2024/04/qm-jx-1.jpeg)\\n\\nJinxi Ancient Town is built along a river and offers a scenic walking path along the waterside. I particularly enjoy wandering through ancient towns at night; there are fewer tourists and the reflections of the night lights on the water are beautiful. The downside is that most attractions are closed, but we were fine with skipping them, as they tend to be very similar across the country.\\n\\nIn the town, we found a noodle shop that served fish soup and wontons. The broth was rich and the fish fresh—it was delicious.\\n\\n## Return Trip\\n\\nWe drove straight back to Shanghai that night, concluding our spring outing.\\n\\nI’d also like to point out that driving habits on highways in China can be problematic. Even on roads with a speed limit of 120 km/h, 90% of drivers tend to maintain speeds around 90-100 km/h in the left lane, which is supposed to be the fast lane. In fact, the right lane often ironically becomes the overtaking lane; driving at 110 km/h made me feel like I was racing as I passed other vehicles—illustrating just how slow other cars were traveling.\\n',\n",
