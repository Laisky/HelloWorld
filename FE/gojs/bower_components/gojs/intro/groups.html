<h2>Groups</h2>
<p>
Use the <a>Group</a> class to treat a collection of <a>Node</a>s and <a>Link</a>s as if they were a single <a>Node</a>.
Those nodes and links are members of the group; together they constitute a subgraph.
</p>

<p>
A subgraph is <em>not</em> another <a>Diagram</a>, so there is no separate HTML Div element for the subgraph of a group.
All of the <a>Part</a>s that are members of a <a>Group</a> belong to the same Diagram as the Group.
There can be links between member nodes and nodes outside of the group as well as links between the group itself and other nodes.
There can even be links between member nodes and the containing group itself.
</p>

<p>
Groups can also be collapsed and expanded, to hide or show the member parts.
</p>

<p>
The member parts of a group are available via the <a>Group.memberParts</a> property.
Conversely, the <a>Part.containingGroup</a> property refers to the group, if the part belongs to one.
A part can be member of at most one group at a time.
You can set that property in order to add that part to a group.
However you must make sure that no group contains itself, either directly or indirectly through other groups.
</p>

<p>
Because every <a>Group</a> is a <a>Node</a>, you can have nested groups.
Although member <a>Node</a>s and <a>Link</a>s belong to the <a>Group</a> that contains them,
they are not in the visual tree of the group -- their <a>GraphObject.panel</a> is null and no member part
is in the group's <a>Panel.elements</a> collection.
No <a>Part</a> can be in the visual tree of another <a>Part</a>.
Parts normally do belong directly to one <a>Layer</a>.
</p>

<h3>Simple Groups</h3>
<p>
In a <a>GraphLinksModel</a> the <a>Model.nodeDataArray</a> holds node data, each of which might be
represented by a <a>Group</a> rather than by a regular <a>Node</a>.
You can declare that it should be a group by setting the isGroup data property to true.
You can declare that a node data be a member of a group by referring to the group's key as
the group data property value.
</p>
<p>
Here is a group containing two nested groups as well as two regular nodes.
If you move a group, its member parts move along.
If you copy a group, its member parts are copied too.
If you delete a group, its member parts are deleted too.
If you move a member node, its containing group inflates or shrinks to cover the area occupied by all of the members.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="simple">
  diagram.model.nodeDataArray = [
    { key: "Alpha", isGroup: true },
    { key: "Beta", group: "Alpha" },
    { key: "Gamma", group: "Alpha", isGroup: true },
    { key: "Delta", group: "Gamma" },

    { key: "Theta", group: "Eta" }
  ];

<h3 id="GroupsLinks">Groups and Links</h3>
<p>
Because <a>Group</a>s are <a>Node</a>s, a <a>Link</a> may connect with a group as well as with a plain node.
</p>
<p>
Here is a simple example of four regular nodes and one group node.
In this example the link from "Alpha" goes directly to the "Beta" node,
but the link to "Delta" actually comes from the "Omega" group rather than from any particular member of the group.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="links">
  var nodeDataArray = [
    { key: "Alpha" },
    { key: "Beta", group: "Omega" },
    { key: "Gamma", group: "Omega" },
    { key: "Omega", isGroup: true },
    { key: "Delta" }
  ];
  var linkDataArray = [
    { from: "Alpha", to: "Beta" },  // from outside the Group to inside it
    { from: "Beta", to: "Gamma" },  // this link is a member of the Group
    { from: "Omega", to: "Delta" }  // from the Group to a Node
  ];
  diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(nodeDataArray, linkDataArray);
</pre>
<script>goCode("links", 600, 150)</script>
<p>
If you drag the "Delta" node around you can see how the link from the "Omega" group appears to come from the center
of the group and start at the group's edge rather than at any member node.
This is different than for the link from "Alpha" to "Beta".
</p>
<p>
Note also how the link from "Beta" to "Gamma" is effectively owned by the "Omega" group because
both of the nodes are owned by that group.  Copying the group automatically copies the link too.
</p>
<p>
This example did not set any of the following properties:
<a>Diagram.nodeTemplate</a>, <a>Diagram.groupTemplate</a>, and <a>Diagram.linkTemplate</a>,
in order to demonstrate the default templates for all kinds of node data and link data.
</p>

<h3>Group Templates</h3>
<p>
Here is an example of how one might define templates for nodes and for groups.
The node template is very simple: some text inside an ellipse.
The group template is different from a node template in several aspects.
</p>
<p>
First, the group template builds a go.Group, not a go.Node or go.Part.
The group can use a number of the panel types, just as a node may use various panel types.
</p>
<p>
Second, the group template includes a <a>Placeholder</a> object.
This object, of which you may have at most one within the visual tree of a group,
gets the size and position of the union of the bounds of the member parts, plus some padding.
The use of a Placeholder results in the Group surrounding the collection of group members,
no matter where the member nodes are placed.
</p>
<pre data-language="javascript" id="groupTemplates">
  diagram.nodeTemplate =
    $(go.Node, "Auto",
      $(go.Shape, "Ellipse", { fill: "white" }),
      $(go.TextBlock,
        new go.Binding("text", "key"))
    );

  diagram.groupTemplate =
    $(go.Group, "Vertical",
      $(go.Panel, "Auto",
        $(go.Shape, "RoundedRectangle",  // surrounds the Placeholder
          { parameter1: 14,
            fill: "rgba(128,128,128,0.33)" }),
        $(go.Placeholder,    // represents the area of all member parts,
          { padding: 5})  // with some extra padding around them
      ),
      $(go.TextBlock,         // group title
        { alignment: go.Spot.Right, font: "Bold 12pt Sans-Serif" },
        new go.Binding("text", "key"))
    );

  var nodeDataArray = [
    { key: "Alpha" },
    { key: "Beta", group: "Omega" },
    { key: "Gamma", group: "Omega" },
    { key: "Omega", isGroup: true },
    { key: "Delta" }
  ];
  var linkDataArray = [
    { from: "Alpha", to: "Beta" },  // from outside the Group to inside it
    { from: "Beta", to: "Gamma" },  // this link is a member of the Group
    { from: "Omega", to: "Delta" }  // from the Group to a Node
  ];
  diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(nodeDataArray, linkDataArray);
</pre>
<script>goCode("groupTemplates", 600, 200)</script>
<p>
Note how when you move the "Beta" or "Gamma" nodes the "Omega" group automatically resizes so that the
TextBlock on the group stays below and on the right side of the "RoundedRectangle" shape.
</p>

<p>
Just as a <a>Diagram</a> can have its own <a>Layout</a>, a <a>Group</a> can have its own <a>Group.layout</a>.
This is discussed in the page about <a href="subgraphs.html">SubGraphs</a>.
