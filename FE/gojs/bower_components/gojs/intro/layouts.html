<h2>Diagram Layouts</h2>
<p>
In general terms, a "layout" is a way of sizing and positioning a collection of objects.
HTML has its own layouts for its HTML elements.
In <b>GoJS</b> you have already seen many examples of Panel layout, such as Auto or Table,
which sizes and positions <a>GraphObject</a>s within a <a>Panel</a>.
<b>GoJS</b> also provides Diagram layouts, which position <a>Node</a>s and route <a>Link</a>s
within a <a>Diagram</a> or a <a>Group</a>.
</p>

<p>
Naturally the principal purpose of each diagram <a>Layout</a> is to position nodes, typically by calling <a>Part.move</a>.
But layouts also may also result in custom routing of the links, by setting properties on each <a>Link</a>.
For example <a>TreeLayout</a> also ensures that links are routed in the expected direction by setting
<a>Link.fromSpot</a> and <a>Link.toSpot</a> depending on the <a>TreeLayout.angle</a>.
(However, that behavior can be disabled by setting <a>TreeLayout.setsPortSpot</a> and <a>TreeLayout.setsChildPortSpot</a>.
The same is true for some other layouts.)
</p>

<p>
Diagram layouts can be accomplished in several manners.
Manual layouts occur because the user moves nodes, thereby establishing new positions for those nodes.
Such layouts might be saved in some persistent data format and later loaded using data binding or assignments in code.
Programmatic layouts happen when some code executes to set the <a>Part</a> position or location.
Automatic layouts are programmatic layouts that are implemented by the <a>Layout</a> class or its subclasses.
</p>

<h3>Default Layout</h3>
<p>
The value of <a>Diagram.layout</a> defaults to an instance of <a>Layout</a>.
This kind of layout is unlike all of the other layout subclasses, in that it only sets the position of nodes
that do not already have a position -- i.e. where the X or Y of the <a>GraphObject.actualBounds</a> is NaN.
It leaves unmodified all nodes that do have a defined position, and it ignores all links.
</p>

<p>
Many of the examples you have seen so far do not set <a>Diagram.layout</a> and thus use the default layout.
Some of the examples data bind the <a>Part.location</a> or <a>GraphObject.position</a> to a data property.
Those examples are basically using manual layout, but with the node positions coming from the node data rather than from
arrangement by the user.
</p>

<p>
However many of the examples just allow the standard behavior of the <a>Layout</a> class to assign positions to the nodes
in the order in which they are seen by the layout.
Those examples are exhibiting automatic layout behavior.
</p>

<h3>Automatic Layouts</h3>
<p>
<b>GoJS</b> offers several kinds of automatic layouts, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a>GridLayout</a></li>
  <li><a>TreeLayout</a></li>
  <li><a>ForceDirectedLayout</a></li>
  <li><a>LayeredDigraphLayout</a></li>
  <li><a>CircularLayout</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
There are samples for each of these layouts, demonstrating the effects of setting various detailed layout properties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../samples/gLayout.html" target="samples">GridLayout Sample</a></li>
  <li><a href="../samples/tLayout.html" target="samples">TreeLayout Sample</a></li>
  <li><a href="../samples/fdLayout.html" target="samples">ForceDirectedLayout Sample</a></li>
  <li><a href="../samples/ldLayout.html" target="samples">LayeredDigraphLayout Sample</a></li>
  <li><a href="../samples/cLayout.html" target="samples">CircularLayout Sample</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
In the introduction pages and samples you will see many examples that make use of automatic layout by setting the <a>Diagram.layout</a> property. <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=%22layout%3A+%26%28go%22&amp;type=Code">Search the sources of the samples for many more examples.</a>
</p>

<h3>Layout Usage</h3>

<p>
You can set <a>Diagram.layout</a> in a JavaScript statement:
</p>
<pre>diagram.layout = new go.ForceDirectedLayout();</pre>
<p>
Or you can initialize that property using <a>GraphObject.make</a>:
</p>
<pre>
var diagram = $(go.Diagram, "myDiagramDiv",
                {
                  initialContentAlignment: go.Spot.Center,
                  layout: $(go.TreeLayout,
                            { angle: 90, nodeSpacing: 10, layerSpacing: 30 })
                });
</pre>
<p>
We recommend using <b>GraphObject.make</b> whenever you can because of the error checking that it does for property names.
</p>

<h3>Grid Layout</h3>

<p>A simple layout for placing Nodes in a grid-like arrangement.</p>

<pre data-language="javascript" id="gridlayout" style="display: none;">
    diagram.layout = $(go.GridLayout);
    diagram.contentAlignment = go.Spot.Center;

    // define a simple Node template
    diagram.nodeTemplate =
      $(go.Node, "Spot",  // the Shape will go around the TextBlock
        $(go.Shape, "Ellipse",
          { fill: 'palegreen', stroke: '#333', strokeWidth: 3, width: 40, height: 40 }
          ),
        $(go.TextBlock,
          { margin: 3, font: 'bold 14px sans-serif', stroke: '#333' },  // some room around the text
          // TextBlock.text is bound to Node.data.key
          new go.Binding("text", "key"))
      );

diagram.linkTemplate =
  $(go.Link,
    // Default routing is go.Link.Normal
    // Default corner is 0
    { corner: 5 },
    $(go.Shape, { strokeWidth: 3, stroke: "#333" })
    );

    // create the model data that will be represented by Nodes and Links
    diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(
    [
      { key: "1" },
      { key: "2" },
      { key: "3" },
      { key: "4" },
      { key: "5" },
      { key: "6" },
      { key: "7" },
      { key: "8" },
      { key: "9" },
      { key: "10" },
      { key: "11" },
    ],
    [
    ]);
</pre>

<h3>Tree Layout</h3>

<p>This layout positions nodes of a tree-structured graph in layers (rows or columns).</p>

<pre data-language="javascript" id="treelayout" style="display: none;">
    diagram.layout = $(go.TreeLayout);
    diagram.contentAlignment = go.Spot.Center;

    // define a simple Node template
    diagram.nodeTemplate =
      $(go.Node, "Spot",  // the Shape will go around the TextBlock
        $(go.Shape, "Ellipse",
          { fill: 'palegreen', stroke: '#333', strokeWidth: 3, width: 40, height: 40 }
          ),
        $(go.TextBlock,
          { margin: 3, font: 'bold 14px sans-serif', stroke: '#333' },  // some room around the text
          // TextBlock.text is bound to Node.data.key
          new go.Binding("text", "key"))
      );

diagram.linkTemplate =
  $(go.Link,
    // Default routing is go.Link.Normal
    // Default corner is 0
    { corner: 5 },
    $(go.Shape, { strokeWidth: 3, stroke: "#333" })
    );

    // create the model data that will be represented by Nodes and Links
    diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(
    [
      { key: "1" },
      { key: "2" },
      { key: "3" },
      { key: "4" },
      { key: "5" },
      { key: "6" }
    ],
    [
      { from: "1", to: "2" },
      { from: "1", to: "3" },
      { from: "3", to: "4" },
      { from: "3", to: "5" },
      { from: "3", to: "6" }
    ]);

<h3>Force-Directed Layout</h3>

<p>Force-directed layout treats the graph as if it were a system of physical bodies with forces acting on them and between them.</p>

<pre data-language="javascript" id="fdlayout" style="display: none;">
    diagram.layout = $(go.ForceDirectedLayout);
    diagram.initialAutoScale = go.Diagram.Uniform;
    diagram.contentAlignment = go.Spot.Center;

    // define a simple Node template
    diagram.nodeTemplate =
      $(go.Node, "Spot",  // the Shape will go around the TextBlock
        $(go.Shape, "Ellipse",
          { fill: 'palegreen', stroke: '#333', strokeWidth: 3, width: 40, height: 40 }
          ),
        $(go.TextBlock,
          { margin: 3, font: 'bold 14px sans-serif', stroke: '#333' },  // some room around the text
          // TextBlock.text is bound to Node.data.key
          new go.Binding("text", "key"))
      );

diagram.linkTemplate =
  $(go.Link,
    // Default routing is go.Link.Normal
    // Default corner is 0
    { corner: 5 },
    $(go.Shape, { strokeWidth: 3, stroke: "#333" })
    );

    // create the model data that will be represented by Nodes and Links
    diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(
    [
      { key: "1" },
      { key: "2" },
      { key: "3" },
      { key: "4" },

      { key: "8" },
      { key: "9" },
      { key: "10" },
      { key: "11" },
    ],
    [
      { from: "6", to: "2" },
      { from: "3", to: "4" },
      { from: "3", to: "5" },
      { from: "3", to: "6" },
      { from: "6", to: "1" },
      { from: "6", to: "7" },
      { from: "4", to: "8" },
      { from: "4", to: "9" },

<h3>Layered Digraph Layout</h3>

<p>This arranges nodes of directed graphs into layers (rows or columns).</p>

<pre data-language="javascript" id="ldllayout" style="display: none;">
    diagram.layout = $(go.LayeredDigraphLayout);
    diagram.contentAlignment = go.Spot.Center;

    // define a simple Node template
    diagram.nodeTemplate =
      $(go.Node, "Spot",  // the Shape will go around the TextBlock
        $(go.Shape, "Ellipse",
          { fill: 'palegreen', stroke: '#333', strokeWidth: 3, width: 40, height: 40 }
          ),
        $(go.TextBlock,
          { margin: 3, font: 'bold 14px sans-serif', stroke: '#333' },  // some room around the text
          // TextBlock.text is bound to Node.data.key
          new go.Binding("text", "key"))
      );

diagram.linkTemplate =
  $(go.Link,
    // Default routing is go.Link.Normal
    // Default corner is 0
    { corner: 5 },
    $(go.Shape, { strokeWidth: 3, stroke: "#333" })
    );

    // create the model data that will be represented by Nodes and Links
    diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(
    [
      { key: "1" },
      { key: "2" },
      { key: "3" },
      { key: "4" },

<h3>Circular Layout</h3>

<p>This layout positions nodes in a circular or elliptical arrangement.</p>

<pre data-language="javascript" id="CircularLayout" style="display: none;">
    diagram.layout = $(go.CircularLayout);
    diagram.contentAlignment = go.Spot.Center;

    // define a simple Node template
    diagram.nodeTemplate =
      $(go.Node, "Spot",  // the Shape will go around the TextBlock
        $(go.Shape, "Ellipse",
          { fill: 'palegreen', stroke: '#333', strokeWidth: 3, width: 40, height: 40 }
          ),
        $(go.TextBlock,
          { margin: 3, font: 'bold 14px sans-serif', stroke: '#333' },  // some room around the text
          // TextBlock.text is bound to Node.data.key
          new go.Binding("text", "key"))
      );

diagram.linkTemplate =
  $(go.Link,
    // Default routing is go.Link.Normal
    // Default corner is 0
    { corner: 5 },
    $(go.Shape, { strokeWidth: 3, stroke: "#333" })
    );

    // create the model data that will be represented by Nodes and Links
    diagram.model = new go.GraphLinksModel(

      { key: "2" },
      { key: "3" },
      { key: "4" },

      { from: "2", to: "5" },
      { from: "1", to: "5" },
      { from: "1", to: "7" },

<h3>Custom Layouts</h3>

<p>
GoJS allows for the creation of custom layouts.
The intro page on <a href="extensions.html">GoJS extensions</a> gives a simple example of a custom layout.
The <a href="../extensions/Serpentine.html">Serpentine</a> and
<a href="../extensions/Fishbone.html">Fishbone</a> extension samples illustrate more complex custom layouts.
</p>


<h3>Layout Invalidation</h3>
<p>
A layout is considered "valid" when it has performed its positioning of its nodes and perhaps routed its links.
However some kinds of changes cause a layout to become "invalid", thereby causing it to be performed again in the near future.
Because layouts can be computationally expensive, automatic layouts are not performed as soon as a layout is invalidated.
Instead they are typically performed at the end of a transaction.
</p>
<p>
The most common reasons for a layout to be invalidated are because a node or a link has been added or removed from the collection
of nodes and links that a layout is responsible for, or because a node or a link has changed visibility, or because a node has changed size.
If you do not want an automatic layout to happen when such a change occurs, it may be easiest to set <a>Layout.isOngoing</a> to false.
</p>
<p>
Another common situation is where you have set <a>Diagram.layout</a> to some kind of layout but you want to load a diagram (model)
that contains manually positioned or adjusted node locations.  The <a>Binding</a> of <a>Part.location</a> to the model data is effective,
but the locations are lost when a layout is performed immediately after loading.  This situation can be avoided by setting
<a>Layout.isInitial</a> to false.  After the initial layout the layout might still be invalidated by adding or removing or changing
the visibility of a node or a link or by a change in node size, unless you have also set <a>Layout.isOngoing</a> to false.
When both <a>Layout.isInitial</a> and <a>Layout.isOngoing</a> are false, you can still explicitly cause a layout to happen by either
calling <a>Layout.invalidateLayout</a> or by calling <a>Diagram.layoutDiagram</a> with a <code>true</code> argument.
</p>
<p>
But if you do not want a change to a particular Node or Link to cause an automatic layout, yet you do want that invalidation for other Nodes or Links,
you can set the <a>Part.layoutConditions</a> property to the combination of <a>Part</a> "Layout..." flags that suits your needs.
It is most common to not want a layout for the <a>Part.LayoutNodeSized</a> condition:
</p>
<pre>
  $(go.Node, . . .,
    { layoutConditions: go.Part.LayoutStandard & ~go.Part.LayoutNodeSized },
    . . .
  )
</pre>
<p>
Parts that remain not visible or that are in layers that are <a>Layer.isTemporary</a> also never invalidate any Layout.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you can set <a>Part.isLayoutPositioned</a> to false in order for the Layout to completely ignore that Part.
But you will have to make sure that that Part does have a real <a>Part.location</a>, since no layout will set it for you.
Without a real location the part will not be visible anywhere in the diagram.
Furthermore if a node has isLayoutPositioned set to false, Layouts will not only ignore that node but also all links connecting with that node.
Because the node will not be moved by the layout, it might overlap with the laid-out nodes and links.
