  <p><b>Beat Paths</b>: The 2007 NFL Season</p>
  <div id="myDiagram" style="border: solid 1px gray; margin: 10px; height: 700px"></div>
  <p>
  This sample demonstrates reading JSON data describing the relative rankings of NFL teams
  at a particular moment of time and generating a diagram from that data.
  The ranking information came from www.beatpaths.com.
  </p>
  <p>
  The JSON data is basically just a list of relationships.
  Unlike most model data, there are no elements describing the nodes --
  the node definitions are implicit in the references from the links.
  Hence the <a>Diagram.model</a> has <a>GraphLinksModel.archetypeNodeData</a> set to a JavaScript object.
  </p>
  <p>
  The node template uses the <b>convertKeyImage</b> function to convert the team name
  into a URI referring to an image on our web site.
