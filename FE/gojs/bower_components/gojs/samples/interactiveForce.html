  <p>
    As you drag a node around, the custom <a>ForceDirectedLayout</a> operates continuously, causing other nodes to be pushed
    aside or pulled along.
  </p>
  <p>
    The graph is exactly the same as the <a href="conceptMap.html">Concept Map</a> sample.
    But the node template is different, and the layout is different.
